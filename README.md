Calculates switch footprint coordinates for keyboard layouts

Uses layout data from the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)

This was written quickly for personal use, so it currently doesn't support rotated keys and a few other features.

All contributions are welcome.
